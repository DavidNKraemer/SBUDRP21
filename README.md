# SBUDRP21

Stony Brook University Directed Reading Program (Spring 2021) on machine learning

We want to build an image classifier that converts handwritten math text to
LaTeX.

# Timeline

# Things left to do...

* Find datasets for training
* Learn how to do image preprocessing in Python (let's find a bunch of tutorials
  and just dump the links here.)
* Set up an actual classifier using Keras or Torch or whatever as the neural
  network basis
* Find some existing models (in papers or in practice, like on Github) where
  people do this (for example, Detexify) and try to replicate them
* Maybe if there's time, do an interactive demo
* Get up to speed on doing deep learning
